Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits
of money. Ignore the possibility of concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.


The BankAccount folder contains two files, account.py and test_account.py.
In account.py there is a skeleton of the bankAccount class with unimplemented methods and in tests.py there are tests for the methods in the bankAccount class. Challenge today is to implement the methods of the bankAccount class and make all tests pass. Passing the tests is the first step, but goal is to have clean readable code that solves the problem and passes all the tests. Feel free to add more methods and tests.
